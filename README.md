# Template for CASE Project
> Created by CASE Board 19/20

**This is a template to be used by all projects in CASE. The template contains a folder structure that covers hardware and software projects. **   

> A sample README by *fvcproductions* can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/fvcproductions/1bfc2d4aecb01a834b46). 

> A cheatsheet by *Adam Pritchard* for writing Markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Goals 
> Write something about the goals of this project and what you want to achieve. 
> Can be something like this:
```
- Utilize more advanced control algorithm.
    - Acceleration control
        - Speed trajectory planner
    - MPC - Model Predictive Conrol (*optional*)
- Reach the moon 
    - With two humans at least 
- Added hardware and improvements
    - 2 MW of power 
    - nRF24 communication
```
